"It seems proper that, in endevoring to explain the reasons which have made me think it desirable
that I should leave behind me such a memorial of so unevenful a life as mine, I ought to prefix it
with some explanation as to the sort of man I was before I became the man I am, as I am old now, and
my pride has been tempered and humbled by the unassaible power of time, and there is no understanding
the man that I became without understanding the man that I once was. A true reflection on my life, one 
that is honest to both myself and the public, would not ignore such an intregral part of my person. And 
I should hope, dear reader, that what is written here will serve as some words of wisdom from a bygone era 
to a future that, it seems, has left this old soul behind.
