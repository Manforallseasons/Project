I was born in 1845. The more elderly, or at the very least, the more educated among my readers, will likely remember the signifigance of that year 
in the History of Ireland. Indeed, I was born at the very begining of the Great Famine. The second of two sons, I never knew my brother. When I was 
but a wee lad, my parents gave him some money to sail off to America, in the hopes that he might make his own fortune, and in turn, bring some of 
that fortune back home.

Alas, it was not to be. My brother wrote to my parents when he could, mentioning that he had found work as a longshoreman in New York, and that 
he had even found steady income. It was a brief few years of hope, until my parents got word that he had died in a shipping accident. While my 
memory of such time is not as defined as it would later become, I still cannot begin to describe the grief that they, and I, knew at his loss.
*line_break
The great irony of the period, for all of us, was that my father found his first bout of financial success as a direct result of the Famine. 
Aside from the loss of my brother, my father's skill as a craftsman, though only of little mention before the famine, had become a deeply coveted 
skill in the now-depopulated County Cork. While we would never become rich enough to own any great land or estate, my father's property was now 
valued at over 40 Shillings, meaning that he, like a few select others in Ireland, now had the right to vote. To no great surprise, he voted 
Whig quite consistantly: He had seen no benefit from Conservative rule either during the famine or after. He was exactly the sort of man the 
Conservatives would be all to disenfranchise.

In any event, my birth, while certainly a source of great joy to my parents, did nothing to make their lives easier. In the summer of 1845, 
I was Christend,

In any event, my youth was, I think, quite typical for the period. I was never able to attend university: the cost of even Trinity for a family 
like my father's, but I still recieved a very fine education for the local schools, and the village priest as well. My education, while 
perhaps not as prestigious as one of Cambridge or Oxford, was no less instrumental or practical. While I recieved a general education, I excelled 
particularily well at,

As I grew older, I began to work in my father's shop. With the rise in his wealth, he had opened up a small, but successful business, one that operated smoothly in the 
wild fluctuations of the Cork market. While I was always happy to work with him, as I got older, I began to develop that particular strain of wanderlust that so often 
infects young men. I desired to see the continent, or London at the least, not wanting Cork, lovely though it was, to be the whole of my existence. I read newpapers 
daily, hoping to catch some glimpse outside the confines of my provincial Irish world. 
*page_break The Fenian Riots
In a strange sense, my wish was granted. Not in an unpleasant way, but in a surprising one, at least. In the waning days of the Winter of 1867, I had been working my 
father's shop diligently, when a young Englishman entered, hoping to be serviced. I attended to his request, and, finding that business had been slow that day, struck 
up a conversation with him. He was a polite man, the pinnacle of English culture by the name of Jack Wright. His father was a news publisher in London, and he himself 
had come to Cork to visit an old friend, only to find, much to his dismay, that the man had died some weeks previous. He had some time before he was scheduled to depart again, 
and found himself quite bored in the interim. Finding that I myself had become quite bored with the lack of work, offered to keep his company during his time here.

We became fast friends, helped in part by Jack's general amiability, though we found with some comedy that we differed on every political issue of the day. 
We spent as much time talking about politics as we did daily life, and the spirit of friendly debate was one that defined our relationship. 
*line_break
On one particularily warm March morning, the topic of conversation had somehow switched to that of Irish Republicanism. And I hope that the reader will forgive me for this brief tangent:
The Fenian Riots were, all-in-all, not the most lasting of political topics. Many older readers might remember them, but I feel that many young ones will have forgotten it. And it is with 
hesitancy that I begin my digression about these riots, unimportant as they may seem now, as they were instrumental in the formation of my own political opinions. Had it not been for 
these events, I might never have become the man I did, and so I feel that to not include them would be a disservice to the audience.
*page_break The Fenians
*image fenian.png center
It is no great secret that many Irish were not pleased with life under the British yoke. Even in America, Irishmen held on to a belief in a national unity beyond even 
physical location. This dissatisfaction with British rule was, of course, nothing new. The Young Irelander Rebellion, in 1848, while ultimately crushed, was but one of 
many expressions of a desire for Irish independence. 
*line_break
Thus, only the most ignorant, or perhaps pigheadded persons, could have possibly been surprised by the Fenian revolt. Although our home and business was spared from 
the fighting (such that we were not even aware of the event until the day after), the event still sent a deep shockwave through all rungs of Irish society. 
*line_break
On March 5th, 1867, batallions, formed by the Fenian Union and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, rose up in opposition to the Empire. Not merely in Ireland, but 
throughout all of the Empire: from Dublin to Cork to Canada. Though they were ultimately defeated by the British and Canadian armies, and the ringleaders were 
very quickly arrested. Despite the rising ultimately being a failure, however, the British government, in time did eventually acquiese to certain Irish demands:
in particular the disestablishment of the Anglican Church as a concession to Irish unrest, though that fact was not known to us in March, only some days after the rebellion.

Asking my opinion on the matter, I replied to Jack that,

		As I said this, Jack looked at me with a look of mixed bemusement and bewilderment. "I'm afraid I never took you for a Monarchist," he said, rather 
		glibly. 
	#I felt that the Fenians, while they had legitimate greviances that deserved addressing, were ultimately too radical for any upstanding republican to support.
		*set republican true
		*set tory_support tory_support + 5
		*set liberal_support liberal_support + 5
		*set home_rule_support home_rule_support + 5
		As I said this, Jack nodded his head, as if considering what I had to say for a few brief moments before speaking.
	#I voiced my full and total support for the Fenians. Too long had the Irish the English and their 'civilizing' capitalism. The formation of an independant Ireland was the only true way forwards.
		*set socialist true
		*set tory_support tory_support - 5
		*set home_rule_support home_rule_support + 20
		Jacks eyes went wide with mild surprise, though he did look almost bemused. Perhaps he hadn't expected me to be so radical in my opinions?

"Well, ${FName}," he started, "I must say I don't fully agree with you. But you argue your points well, and you're no doubt passionate about them, and I admire that." 
And with that, the topic was dropped.

Some few days later, Jack came in to my father's shop. Apparently, he was scheduled to leave the next day, and needed to prepare for his departure. I was sad to see 
him go, as I had grown quite fond of him in the days he had been here, and apparently the feeling was quite mutual. As we were exchaning farewells, he left me with 
this bit of charity:
*line_break
"Well, ${FName}, if you should ever find yourself in London, do look up my father and I. I'm sure he'd be overjoyed to have someone like you working with him." I thanked 
him for the offer, and he took his leave. Over the next few years, I kept up correspondence with him, but the distance between us, and his constant travelling, meant that 
the letters could come at wildly disparate paces. 
*line_break
For the next 3 years or so, I continued to work in my father's shop, but that sense of wanderlust never quite left me. With my father now successful enough to hire his own 
employees, I asked for his and mother's blessing to make my way to London, and he (quite reluctantly!) allowed it. In almost no time at all, I had packed 
all my luggage, and had bought passage from Cork to London. At long last, would I see a world outside the province!
