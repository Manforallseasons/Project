It may, in truth, surprise many readers that I was not, in fact, the first MP of Indian descent, though 
I do hold the perhaps technical honor being the first Indian MP to take his seat in Parliament. However, before me, 
one man, a certain David Ochterlony Dyce Sombre, had originally been elected to the House of Commons as far back as 1841, but 
was barred from sitting due to accusations of bribery.

But for all that was strange about my parliament days, there was much about my youth that was exceedingly normal. My father, 
a member of the Honorable East India Association, was far-and-away more wealthy than many other Indians at the period: 
he had taken full advantage of the European occupations, and enthusiastically traded with just about every European that 
crossed his path. Quick to adapt to new situations, my father quickly amassed a not-insubstantial wealth. Despite his 
enthusiasm for his work, he was always a present figure in my life.

My parents were nothing but kind and doting, and when I was born in 1844, they named me,

Growing up, as I did, so far from Britannia's shores, it might surprise any number of less-travelled types that I had, in fact, recieved a perfectly adequate eduction. 
Although I would not necissarily blame them for not knowing, it is a fact that, as a result of the famous 'Wood's Dispatch', the University of Mumbai, along with a 
vast number of other schools, were founded in India in 1854 and the following years. While the price of attendence could be prohibitively expensive, I was perfectly capable of 
attending due to my father's not-insignifigant wealth. 
*line_break
My university days were not, as one might think, of particular note. The school was perfectly adequate as an educational institution, and not particularily different from 
university elsewhere in Europe: this was the intent, after all. The hope of the Wood's Dispatch was to establish schools to teach English, and in turn, ensure the security of 
British rule in the region through a complex system of beauracratic power. 
*line_break
My eduction was, as I mentioned, quite typical, though I found in my university years that I excelled in the field of,

		*set Edu_Military true

		While I never was given the chance to join the military like my younger self would've liked, I still found some solace in that

*line_break
My education passed with little fanfare, and I graduated in 1866. Immediately, like many educated Indians, I found work with in the Colonial Beauracracy. 
Working as a low-level customs officer in Mumbai was respectable, if a bit unambitious. I had missed the Opium wars by a few years, and so my job 
scarcely involved any real customs trafficking. Besides that, whenever the chance that I might find some acutal illegal cargo or uncover 
some smuggling operation actually showed itself, more senior officers were more than happy to 'relieve' me of such work, that they might take the credit.
*line_break
And so, I spent most of my time in the service of the East India Company reading books and papers to pan out those brief periods of time when I did have 
some work. Ironically, it was one of those brief periods of work that I did happen upon that most peculiar of events that would radically change the 
trajectory of my life.
*page_break
I had recieved message of an English ship that had docked, and the port authority had declared one man's goods illegal for exporting without a license.
The issue was not a particularily important one, as it turned out. The man, an English Physician by the name of Jack Wright, had been carrying alcohol on his person: 
a necessary tool of a doctor of course, and one of the port guards had misunderstood the specifics of the tarrif: as the bottle was personal, and not meant for consumption, 
it was not necessary for Mr. Wright to pay the extant tarrif on spirits. A simple mistake, and the man's goods were returned to him in the span of a few hours after confiscation. 
*line_break
Mr. Wright turned out to be a perfectly amiable fellow. While he was waiting for the necessary paperwork to be processed, we struck up a conversation on some topic that I have 
now forgotten, but it can assure you, dear reader, that it was a wonderfully intense one. But in time, his materials came back, and we bid each other adieu, each thinking that 
we would not see one another again.
*line_break
But, as fate would have it, the very next day, I ran into Mr. Wright again on the streets. Finding that neither of us had much to do, we took our leave of the streets and 
availed ourself of a nearby food shop. There was a small number of tables and chairs located outside, and the place sold foodstuffs that would've been familiar to Europeans: 
the whole restauraunt had become successful from Europeans hoping for a small taste of home.
*line_break
Jack, as it turned out, was a perfectly amiable man, though somewhat ignorant of life in India. Apparently, he was here on a visit to my Alma matter, the University of 
Mumbai, in order to take stock of the medical department: mostly out of professional curiosity, though I doubted that was the whole story: A voyage all the way to 
India from London was not something done out of mere whim, but I decided not to press the issue.
*line_break
The two of us spoke for quite some time about a variety of topics. While we had a seemingly endless font of discussions, it was with some humor that we found 
that we disagreed on nearly all political topics of the day. Despite this, it did not stop us from discussing these things, and the spirit of friendly debate was 
one that prevailed.
*line_break
While we did eventually need to take leave of one another, we agreed to meet again, and our converstations quickly became a normal part of daily life for the month that 
Jack visited. We discussed nearly everything: religion, philosophy, and, of course, politics. On one particular afternoon, the topic of Duleep Singh, a now-exiled 
Maharaja. 
*line_break
I hope that the reader will forgive me for my digression here: the deposed Maharaja was but a footnote in the grander narrative of British politics at the time, and 
so dedicating so much time to one topic might seem strange. But should like to state that, while perhaps he was not as important as I this reading might imply, 
that he was absolutely fundamental in the formation of my own political person, in some way or another. Indeed, without the man, or the topics surrounding him, 
I doubt that I may have become the man that I did.
*page_break The Last Maharaja
*image singh.jpg center
Duleep Singh, born in 1838, rose to the throne of Punjab in 1843. The political instability in Punjab, as well as the Anglo-Sikh war in 1849, meant that 
the young Maharaja was deposed at the tender age of 10. The young man spent some time travelling between Lahore and other Indian states, converting to the 
church of England in the meantime. In the year of 1855, when he found passage to London, and was thrown into the royal court.
*line_break
As it turns out, the court was abosolutely wild about him: even Queen Victoria herself took a keen liking to him, even inviting him to stay with the royal family 
at Osborne. All in all, the English court and nobility found him fascinating and exotic, and the English people followed suit, though just as many in both 
cases yet held reactionary beliefs about Indians in general.
*line_break
Despite these obvious setbacks, however, the man had managed to endeer himself to both the aristoracy and the journalistic classes in England, and 
many Indians living in England proper, not to mention the commonwealth, saw him as an inspirational figure. While it seems that nothing 
ever did truly come out of it, many felt that having someone so close to the Queen who was sympathetic to the plights of the natives in India 
would signal a true reform in their treatment.
*line_break
In discussing the man, and his sudden popularity in England, Jack endeavored to ask my thoughts on the man, and I answered.

*line_break
Jack nodded his head, as if in contemplation of my point. "Well, ${FName}, I won't say I agree with you, as I don't, but I must admit that you make 
a compelling argument, and you present it well," he said. The topic was dropped, and that was that.
*line_break
Or, at least it was, until some days later, when Jack and I met again, as had become our habit. He had clearly been mulling over something, and with a 
degree of hesitence, he begain to ask, "Listen, ${FName}, I have spent these past few days wondering. You have made mention of your discontent with 
work as a customs officer, and I believe I know a position where you might be more comfortable," he began. "My father, he runs a small publishing 
company in London. He runs a variety of different pieces, many of which cater to a wide, diffused population in London. Would you perhaps, 
consider working as a journalist? I know that this is a strange thing to ask so suddenly, but I was so taken by your passion and knowledge of 
political issues that I felt that I must ask."
*line_break
I considered Jack's offer for a long moment. It was, of course, an unusual offer, though far from bizzare. I did admit that work in the custom's 
office had lead seemingly nowhere, and I expressed my desire to find more profitable, and satisfying, work. Not to mention, my father would see 
work as a journalist in London something deeply prestigious. The next day, finding Jack again, I agreed to his offer, and he was ecstatic. 
*line_break
We made plans to leave Bombay in a weeks time, and, after saying my goodbyes to my loved ones, I boarded the steam carrier to London. My 
aspirations had lead me to the heart of the Empire, and, political feelings aside, I hoped to see it in all it's glory.
