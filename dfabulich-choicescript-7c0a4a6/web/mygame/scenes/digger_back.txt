"It is perhaps no surprise, then, that I was born in that most auspicious year of revolution, 1848.
My uprbringing so close to London, but just on the outskirts, was quite far from typical. 
My father, a tall, industrious man, was scarcely home, often making excursions to London 
for the purpose of political agitation. My mother, conversely was often home, though
perhaps she was not the typical housemaid so-often associated with what motherhood entails.
Though perhaps she was not a well-known personality in London, I quite distinctly remember 
my mother writing correspondence whenever the opprotunity was presented. Much of my earliest education 
came from the reading of these letters, and I recall the adressees and senders of many of them: 
Leigh Smith Bodichon and Lydia Becker among them. While many of those that my mother corresponded 
with would go on to found some notable organizations (of varites Feminist, Socialist, and Temperate), 
my mother, it seems, was more than content to make a living at home. Age, it seems, had tempered her, 
though I can assure you, dear reader, that there had always been a streak of Radicalism in her that 
seemed to manifest at perhaps the most bizzare moments.

Of course, as is wont to happen upon the birth of a first child, much of my parents life was thrown into disarray. 
What had once been the domain of two in an uncommon harmony, was now the unruly discord of three. 
I was born, I am told, on a cool January morning in what would become known to history as the "Springtime of 
the Peoples". My father, despite his protestations, eventually aquiesced to my mother's request for my 
Baptism, and in the cool of January, I was christend

But for all my parent's radicalism and defiance of tradition, my boyhood was exceedingly typical. I lived, worked, 
and played in the green hills of Surrey all through my youth, and, perhaps to no great surprise, I consider such 
days the greatest of my early life. But, as a wiser man once said, all good things must come to an end, and mine 
ended on those first days of attending university.

That's not to say I was ungreatful, though. Quite the contrary. The opportunity to study at the University of Cambridge, 
far and away one of the most prestigious universities in all of the Union, was not a minor thing. My education was, again, 
quite standard for the period: I recieved education in the humanities, the classics, mathematics, theology, and, of course, the sciences.

It was during these years, then, that I got my first taste of the political discourse of the age. It was a warm May morning in Cambridge, 
and I had gone out with a good friend of mine, a certain Jack Wright. He was an agreeable man: the son of a London newsman, 
and we got on splendidly, save for those moments where the topics of the day came up. There, we were of two minds on nearly everything.

Of particular strain to our relationship was the events of that last weeks of that May month. Sitting, as had become our custom for sunday afternoons, in 
a crowded Cambridge pub, I had been thoroughly engrossed in the latest edition of my standard newpaper,

I hope the reader will forgive my brief digression here. The events that occured in Paris in these short few weeks were, 
in truth, only a minor prelude in the broader discussions of the day in the Union. But the events in the Commune were deeply 
influential in the greater formation of my own political style, and the manner of politician that I would later become. 
*page_break The Paris Commune
*image commune.jpg center A barricade in the Paris Commune, March 18, 1871. Source: Hachette Biblio College, Les Miserables. 
Immediately following the defeat of Emperor Napoleon III in the September of the previous year, the final knell of the Second Empire 
was rung in the ears of all of Europe. France, in particular, was most shaken by this political upset for obvious reasons. With the 
disolution of the Second Empire, the Third French Republic was founded in its stead, continuing its war with the nascent German Empire. 
*line_break
For nearly four months, Prussian troops laid seige to the City of Lights, and since the forces of the Republic were too far away to 
defend the city, the defense of Paris came mostly from the National Guard instead. The same National Guard that had, in previous years 
become increasingly radical: famously overthrowing the last Bourbon monarch in 1848, effectively signaling the end of Monarchism in France.
*line_break
In February of the next year, Adolphe Thiers, the new Chief Executive of the Third Republic, signed the Treaty of Frankfurt, disarming the 
regular Army but not the National Guard. With the prolonged seige of Paris, and the previous uprisings, strikes, and revolts in Paris against 
the Emperor, and then the national government, the city of Paris had become a powder keg waiting to burst. In mid-March, National Guard forces 
refused to reliquish some now-obselete bronze cannons that had been payed for by the citizens of Paris by subscription. Compromise was attempted, 
but ultimately, talks broke down, and the national government fled the city, leaving it in the hands of the National Guard. The National Guard 
declared that it, above the elected Republican mayors, was the legitimate steward of Paris. The mayor was ousted, and the National Guard seized 
city hall.
*line_break
New elections were held on March 26th, with both the Central Committee and the Internationale declaring its support for certain candidates, 
almost all of them quite far-left. Upper class citizens generally refrained from voting, leaving most of the votes to the working-class. 
Of the 92 council seats granted, 25, mostly Republicans, elected not to take their seats in protest, meaning that in practice, only 60 
council seats were actually in use. 
*line_break
Despite these seeming setbacks, the Commune leaders declared victory, and many in the working class celebrated what would become the first 
Socialist state. While such jubilee might seem premature now, with the benefit of posterity, it was hard not to see the Commune as some herald 
of leftist success. Though, of course, then came the May invasion.
*page_break The Fall of the Commune
The Commune lasted hardly two months before falling to the Republican Government Forces. On May 21st, the Commune fell, and the city was 
once again part of the French Republic. While the events of the week would later go on to be known as 'Bloody Week', at the beginning, in 
those innocent, early days of the week, one could be forgiven for thinking that the Republican forces would not be so brutal as they turned 
out to be.

	"And So what if I do think that?" I asked, impetuously. "As far back the 40s, Voltaire himself spoke of the divisions in society: the political one,

	arugment, and I could feel the eyes of some of the nearby tables on me, but I was rolling, and I felt a compulsive need to correct Jack. "The Republic 
	is, to its credit, propery concerned with the Political Question: The right to vote, and to sufferage, and to the protection of one's liberties, are 
	all ensured in the Republic. But as the second Republic proved, those same men are wholly unconcerned with the Social Question: They abhor the socialist 
	movements with all aplomb, and work tirelessly to ensure that no law that would improve the lives of the French working-class should ever find its way 
	to the desk of the president. What, then, are the Parisians meant to do? Their labor held up the Empire, and then the Repulic, during the war, and

I ended my tirade with a uncharacteristic definitiveness. The area around our table outside the cafe had gone briefly silent, but the voices quickly picked up again 
after a brief pause. Jack had a bewildered, if impressed, look on his face. After some time, he leaned forwards, and said, "Well, I can't say I agree with you, 
${FName}, but I'll say this much: you argue your points well. If you were to run for the Commons, I think I'd, begrudginly, vote for you," he finished, before smiling

I graduated in the summer some two years later. My parent's pride, I was more than happy to revel in those days following my academic success, though certain realities 
soon made themselves manifest: I was no longer a student, and I had no place of employment, a problem all-to-common in those days, even for the educated classes.
The financial crisis had taken much out of the pockets of everyone.
I was apprehensive about my future prospects, until, in a fit of good fortune, my old friend Jack Wright approached me to make an offer.

"${FName}," he began, "I know that you've been struggling to find employment. Most are in this economy. I know that we differ on nearly every issue, but 
there's not a man out there I'd trust to espouse what he believes more passionately and articulately. I'm going back to London to practice medicine, and I 
know my father'd be happy to hire you to write for his paper, if you're willing to work for him."

I wasted no time. I packed all of my belongings (which, I realized at the time, was not very much), and I bought two tickets from Cambridge to King's Cross for Jack 
and myself. The train left on the following Sunday, and I felt an uncommon sense of excitement. To be working! As a Journalist in London, no less! I never had 
such ambitions even in my best university days. We boarded the train, and I felt the carriage lurch forward as it departed for The Great Wen. This would be 
the first step on rise up the ladder of British politics, and I had been lucky enough so far: only time will tell how far I climbed.
